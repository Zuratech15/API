This project gets the latest top news from the United States using the NewsAPI and stores the collected data in a SQLite database. The project is executed in Python and utilizes several libraries for its functionality 
The News Fetcher project works by making an API request to NewsAPI using a provided API key to get the latest top news from the United States, parsing the JSON response, and saving the data to news_data.json. It then reads this JSON file, prints the author, title, and description of each article, and stores the articles in a SQLite database (news.db). If the news table does not exist, it creates it with columns for title, description, author, URL, and publication date, inserts the article data, commits the transaction, and closes the database connection.
